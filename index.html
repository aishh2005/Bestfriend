        <p>Hey babeeeeee,</p>
        <p>SOOO SORRY for today. I just wanted to surprise you in a different way but it took so long to complete. I know, tula ek burger dila asta tari tu khush zali astis, but mala kahi tari new karaicha hota. Mahit nai tula kiti avdel, but just try kela... kasa vatla sang ha... nai avadla tari tasa sang ha...</p>
        <p>Babee, you mean a lot to me. You are my everything, the most beautiful person I have in my life. You fill my heart with joy and laughter. You are my most precious gift, my inspiration, my motivation, my role model, my motivator, and so much more...</p>
        <p>I love the way you approach life, which inspires me to be a better person every day.</p>
        <p>Being with you is the best time of my life, and I want to explore more and more with you.</p>
        <p>Sorry for making you sad sometimes, like today. Sorry for making you cry or feel bad because of me. I just want to see you happy as always, with your wrinkles.</p>
        <p>I love your madness and love you just as you are. Please be with me forever and keep giving me khup sara trasss, as it makes you happy and that makes me happy. You know, without Chandler, Joey is all alone.</p><br>

        <p>It’s not just about the good times; you’re there even when things are hard, providing the support I need. You’re my sister, my best friend, someone who understands me better than I sometimes understand myself.</p>
        <p>I am grateful for your presence in my life every single day.</p><br>
